# Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor
### The problem focuses on detecting an object in the vicinity and indicating itâ€™s distance. This system can be modified further and used as a security alarm, water level measuring, etc. This can be used in parking lots to detect obstacles. It can also be used for blind people to detect obstacles. We hereby are trying to make a distance sensor without using microcontrollers. There are three components in the project:
- Detection component
- Calculation component
- Display component
